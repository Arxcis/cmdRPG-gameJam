The simple hardcoded version&lt;3

### Rules - "To keep it simple"

- For input and output, we only use:
   cin
   cout

- The source-code should be contained within maximum two files.
   main.cpp
   graphics.h

- This code uses structs and only structs, as the highest level datatype (no classes, enums, interfaces..blabla)
